# Three-Body Problem Simulation Generator

This is a fork of [ThreeBodyBot](https://github.com/kirklong/ThreeBodyBot) that was used for my final project in Dr. Marcin Abram's PHYS 304 class. 

The scripts and used to generate three body simulations is included here. The `threeBodyProb.jl` Julia script was used to make the simulations for several Lagrange configurations, while the Jupyter notebook `threeBodyStability.ipynb` was used to generate the figure eight simulation and T-P stability plots. All the simulations and plots can be found in the results folder.

If you want to run this script and generate simulations yourself, please refer to the documentation in the original repository.
